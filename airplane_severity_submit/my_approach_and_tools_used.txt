**********************HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge:Calculate the severity of an airplane accident.**********************

************** MY APPROACH FOR THE PROBLEM STATEMENT **************

1.In the given dataset 'Severity' column is the target variable which we need to predict.
	Severity of plane crash can take any of the 4 classes.
	Hence, this problem statement is a classification problem.

2.Exploring the given train dataset and visualising using graph plots.

3.For preprocessing,
	 i.we look for NaN or missing values and handle them is any values are missing.
	ii.Then if any multiple data types present in same column.
	iii. Handling String values.

	In the given dataset there were *No Missing values*.

	"Severity" column had string values representing the classes. 
	Hence we assign dummy numerical value to each of the classes here 0-3 respectively for 4 classes.

4.Then in Feature Engineering,
	we apply preprocessing or Standard Scalar to the data before training the Machine Learning Model.

5.Machine Learning Algorithm,
	Since this is a classification problem, we have number of classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine, KNN etc.
	Here I used Support Vector Classifier for training and predictions.

6.Then we evaluate the classifier model with train set using Accuracy_score and f1_score.
